    "FakeQuakes is a set of semistochastic foward modeling codes from the github repository [MudPy](https://github.com/dmelgarm/MudPy).  FakeQuakes was created by __Dr. Diego Melgar__ (professor at the Unviersity of Oregon), and the components are outlined in the paper [__Kinematic rupture scenarios and synthetic displacement data: An example application to the Cascadia subduction zone__ (Melgar et al., 2016)](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2016JB013314).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This set of codes generates synthetic rupture models and can generate low frequency displacement waveforms and broadband acceleration waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to use FakeQuakes, you can refer to this [wiki page](https://github.com/taranye96/tsuquakes/wiki/FakeQuakes-Script) on my github account.  This page walks you through how to set up the parameter file (__.fq.py__) listed in the [tsuquakes](https://github.com/taranye96/tsuquakes) respository and how to run the different steps in FakeQuakes.  If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me or Diego Melgar.\n",
